# Goals - Optimization Targets

**Goals are functional outcomes you want to optimize for.** Unlike axes (which describe internal state), goals describe what you want to BE GOOD AT in a given moment or period.

---

## Philosophy

```
AXES = "How do I feel?"        (internal state)
GOALS = "What can I do well?"  (functional outcomes)

Multiple axes combine to enable each goal.
Goals often TRADE OFF against each other.
You cannot optimize everything simultaneously.
```

## Goal Profiles (Detailed)

### FOCUS (Deep Work)

**What it is:** The ability to sustain narrow attention on a single complex task for extended periods (1-4+ hours).

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   HIGH (content, not seeking)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (alert, not tired)
Autonomic:      CALM (not stressed)
Metabolic:      STABLE (keto or steady glucose)
```

**Supporting factors:**
- High effective dopamine → can stay on task without seeking novelty
- Low adenosine → mental clarity
- Parasympathetic dominance → relaxed alertness
- Ketones or stable glucose → no energy crashes
- Ultradian peak/plateau phase → natural focus window

**Enemies:**
- Low dopamine (seeking, distracted)
- Sleep debt (can't sustain)
- High sympathetic (anxious, scattered)
- Glucose crashes (brain fog)
- Phone/notifications (breaking concentration)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
timing: Morning after cortisol peak (2-3h after wake)
fuel: Fasted or keto (stable energy)
caffeine: Yes, but delayed 90-120 min from wake
environment: No phone, no notifications, single task
duration: 90 min blocks (ultradian cycle)
```

---

### EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (Complex Planning)

**What it is:** The ability to hold multiple variables in working memory, plan sequences, inhibit impulses, and make complex decisions.

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   HIGH (can delay gratification)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (working memory needs ATP)
Autonomic:      MODERATE (some activation helps)
Metabolic:      STABLE
```

**Why it's expensive:**
```
Executive function uses ~15-20% of brain ATP when active.
It's the FIRST to degrade with fatigue.
"Can't think straight when tired" = executive function offline.
```

**Supporting factors:**
- Prefrontal cortex well-fueled
- Low sleep debt (working memory crashes with fatigue)
- Moderate stress (some cortisol helps)
- Not hungry (decision fatigue)

**Enemies:**
- Sleep deprivation (massive impairment)
- Decision fatigue (depletes through day)
- Low glucose
- High stress (narrows thinking)
- Alcohol (directly impairs PFC)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
timing: First 4 hours after wake (before depletion)
fuel: Fed state OK, avoid crashes
sleep: 7-9h previous night CRITICAL
decisions: Batch important ones early
environment: Quiet, no interruptions
```

---

### LEARNING / NEUROPLASTICITY

**What it is:** The ability to encode new information that persists into long-term memory.

**Required axes:**
```
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (alertness for encoding)
Autonomic:      MODERATE (some stress enhances)
Dopaminergic:   MODERATE (novelty helps, too high = complacent)
```

**The two-phase requirement:**
```
LEARNING = ENCODING (awake) + CONSOLIDATION (sleep)

You can encode while awake, but it's not "saved" until sleep.
All-nighters = encoding without consolidation = lost.
```

**Supporting factors:**
- BDNF elevated (exercise, fasting, novelty)
- Acetylcholine (attention marks what to save)
- Moderate stress (emotional salience helps)
- Sleep that night (consolidation)
- Testing yourself (4x better than passive)
- Spacing (not cramming)

**Enemies:**
- Sleep deprivation (can't consolidate)
- Chronic high cortisol (hippocampal damage)
- Passive consumption (weak encoding)
- Massed practice (cramming)
- Age > 25 without enhancers (higher threshold)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
timing: Any time with good alertness
method: Active recall, testing, teaching others
spacing: Review at increasing intervals
exercise: Before learning (↑BDNF)
sleep: 7-9h that night (non-negotiable)
enhancers:
  - Exercise before session
  - Fasting (↑BDNF)
  - Cold exposure (↑NE, ↑BDNF)
  - Novel environment
```

---

### CREATIVITY (Divergent Thinking)

**What it is:** The ability to generate novel ideas, make unusual connections, see things from new angles.

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   MODERATE (too high = exploiting, too low = stuck)
Adenosinergic:  MODERATE (slightly tired can help!)
Autonomic:      RELAXED (para-dominant)
```

**The creativity paradox:**
```
Creativity often IMPROVES when slightly tired.
Why? Executive function (the "filter") weakens.
Unusual associations slip through.

This is why shower thoughts work - you're relaxed, unfocused.
Morning pages work - you're not fully "on" yet.
```

**Supporting factors:**
- Diffuse mode (not focused)
- Ultradian trough phase (dreamy state)
- Walking (optic flow + diffuse thinking)
- Low pressure (not deadline-driven)
- Novel inputs (cross-pollination)

**Enemies:**
- Hyperfocus (too narrow)
- High stress (tunnel vision)
- Too much caffeine (too focused)
- Pressure/deadlines (narrows thinking)
- Same environment daily (stale inputs)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
timing: Late evening OR early morning (tired states)
        Ultradian trough (dreamy phase)
fuel: NOT fasted (slight glucose helps)
caffeine: None or light
activity: Walking, showering, relaxed
method: Free association, mind-wandering allowed
constraint: Some constraint helps (e.g., "solve X in 3 ways")
```

---

### SOCIAL ENERGY (Willingness to Engage)

**What it is:** The internal motivation to seek out and engage in social interaction. The "do I want to go out?" state.

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   MODERATE-HIGH (social = rewarding)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (need energy to engage)
Autonomic:      BALANCED (not too stressed, not too flat)
Metabolic:      GLYCOLYTIC (carbs help social energy!)
```

**The keto trade-off:**
```
Keto = stable energy, clear focus, low social reactivity
Carbs = more variable, but MORE SOCIAL SPONTANEITY

This is why:
- Business meetings → keto OK (structured)
- Parties/friends → carbs better (spontaneous)
```

**Supporting factors:**
- Good sleep (energy to expend)
- Carbs in system (social reactivity)
- Moderate dopamine (social feels rewarding)
- Low social anxiety (para-dominance helps)

**Enemies:**
- Sleep deprivation (withdraw)
- Keto (can be too flat)
- Low dopamine (can't be bothered)
- High stress (avoidant)
- Depression (anhedonia)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
timing: Evening (natural social time)
fuel: Some carbs earlier in day
caffeine: Moderate
sleep: Well-rested
pre-activity: Light exercise (↑mood)
avoid: Deep keto if planning to socialize
```

---

### SPONTANEITY / WIT (Quick Social Responses)

**What it is:** The ability to respond quickly, banter, make jokes, riff in conversation. The "quick on your feet" state.

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   HIGH (ideas flow freely)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (processing speed)
Autonomic:      RELAXED (not self-monitoring)
Androgenic:     MODERATE-HIGH (confidence to express)
```

**Why it's hard to force:**
```
Spontaneity requires:
1. Fast association (dopamine)
2. Low filter (not anxious)
3. Willingness to risk (testosterone/confidence)

If you're monitoring yourself → you're not spontaneous.
```

**Supporting factors:**
- High dopamine (associations flow)
- Low anxiety (not filtering)
- Confidence (willing to say things)
- Practice (builds automaticity)
- Alcohol (reduces filter - not recommending, explaining)

**Enemies:**
- Social anxiety (over-filtering)
- Low dopamine (slow, effortful)
- Sleep deprivation (slow processing)
- Overthinking (kills spontaneity)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
state: Well-rested, fed, moderate dopamine
mindset: "Nothing matters" (low stakes framing)
practice: Improv, banter with friends
avoid: High-stakes framing, overthinking
note: Paradoxically, trying to be witty kills it
```

---

### FLIRTING / ATTRACTION

**What it is:** The state where you're engaging romantically/sexually, projecting attractiveness, and reading signals.

**Required axes:**
```
Androgenic:     HIGH (drive, confidence, pheromones)
Dopaminergic:   HIGH (social reward circuitry)
Autonomic:      RELAXED but ACTIVATED (confident energy)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (presence, processing)
```

**The retention effect:**
```
Days 7-14 of retention:
- Testosterone peaks (~145% at day 7)
- Androgen receptors upregulate
- Pheromone production increases
- Confidence naturally higher
- Eye contact easier
- Voice deeper
- Coordination better

This is observable, not placebo.
```

**Supporting factors:**
- Retention (days 7-14 sweet spot)
- High testosterone
- Good sleep (attractiveness studies)
- Exercise (posture, confidence)
- Presence (not distracted)

**Enemies:**
- Recent ejaculation (prolactin surge → flat)
- Sleep deprivation (less attractive + low confidence)
- High stress (cortisol antagonizes testosterone)
- Distraction (not present)
- Trying too hard (lack of outcome independence)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
retention: 7+ days
sleep: Well-rested (appearance + energy)
exercise: Morning (testosterone peak)
timing: Evening (circadian social window)
fuel: Some carbs (social reactivity)
mindset: Outcome independence
```

---

### PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE (Strength/Endurance)

**What it is:** The ability to generate force and sustain physical output.

**Required axes:**
```
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (ATP availability)
Androgenic:     HIGH (testosterone for strength)
Metabolic:      VARIES (glycolytic for power, keto for endurance)
Autonomic:      ACTIVATED (sympathetic for performance)
```

**Fuel mode matters:**
```
POWER/STRENGTH (lifting, sprinting):
- Glycolytic better
- Glucose = fast energy
- Keto can work but slightly impaired

ENDURANCE (long runs, hikes):
- Keto better after adaptation
- Fat = unlimited fuel
- No bonking
```

**Supporting factors:**
- Sleep (recovery, testosterone)
- Fed for power, fasted OK for endurance
- Hydration + electrolytes
- Caffeine (performance boost)
- Warm-up (injury prevention)

**Optimal protocol:**
```yaml
strength:
  timing: Late afternoon (circadian peak)
  fuel: Carbs 2-3h before
  caffeine: 30-60 min before

endurance:
  timing: Morning OK
  fuel: Fasted or keto (fat-adapted)
  hydration: Critical (electrolytes)
```

---

### COORDINATION / PRECISION (Fine Motor)

**What it is:** The ability to execute precise, smooth movements. Typing, sports, music, catching things.

**Required axes:**
```
Dopaminergic:   HIGH (motor precision is dopamine-dependent)
Adenosinergic:  HIGH (processing speed)
Autonomic:      BALANCED (not shaky)
Androgenic:     HELPS (proprioception)
```

**The retention observation:**
```
On retention:
- Catch things normally dropped
- Type faster, fewer errors
- Move through crowds smoothly
- Feel weight of objects precisely

WHY:
- Dopamine controls motor precision
- Testosterone enhances proprioception
- Cerebellum processing speed increases
```

**Supporting factors:**
- High dopamine (fine motor control)
- Good sleep (reaction time)
- Low anxiety (steady hands)
- Retention (multiple mechanisms)
- Warm-up (neural priming)

**Enemies:**
- Alcohol (obvious)
- Sleep deprivation (slow reactions)
- High anxiety (tremor)
- Low dopamine (clumsy)
- Caffeine excess (jittery)
