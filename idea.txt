Okay so the idea is to

Make a

Body simulator, enter keto, need to replenish water and electrolytes

The idea is that it operates on timefreames, and we have a ui to make it do things and see what happens

When doing sample activities


The basis is $user/git/protocol-experimetns/  /mcts-simple

In our case instead of an mcts we'll jsut make it do things of course we can go back in time and do another thing.

We need

1. tme frame activity system
3. Dimensions and subsystems of the body clearly defined
    And visualized
2. A way to define activities effects


Look up in my gemini and google drive

We can reference andrew huberman

And then the goal is to make some sort of renderer like


A concpet also similar to "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKT-sKtR970"

"Simulating an Entire Car Engine (yes, it makes noise)"
But for a human body

Also lets try to reference what is the state of the art for something like this



in rust for speed and type safety
we need to see how to implement the different subsystems


then do simulations with different factors and make sure the researdch online and ai odels validate what we see


And also be albe to better plan how best to do x validating the response of the AI
